What we have already:
1) The grid is set up with dark lines seperating the 3x3 subgrids
2) All cells share a class, and each has a unique id as well

4) In otherwords, the game board is set up, but it's not terribly responsive

What we need:

2) That input needs to affect our grid array
3) Create solve button
4) Reset button
5)
