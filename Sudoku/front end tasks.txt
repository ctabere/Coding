What we have already:
1) The grid is set up with dark lines seperating the 3x3 subgrids
2) All cells share a class, and each has a unique id as well
3) Using CSS, the cells will highlight on mouseover and check clicked, a different color
4) In otherwords, the game board is set up, but it's not terribly responsive
5) Create solve button
6) Reset button
7) Numpad on screen to take user input


What we need:

2) That input needs to affect our grid array.  Once the user finishes inputting the puzzle values, press the solve button.  
3) add onClick to solve button and run the solve function
3) link updates to grid to updates on screen
4) reset button should clear grid, but a page reload may be easiest
5) create message if puzzle is invalid or if multiple solutions exist
